  abstract = {Cells form spatial patterns by coordinating their gene expressions. How a group of mesoscopic numbers (hundreds to thousands) of cells, without pre-existing morphogen gradients and spatial organization, self-organizes spatial patterns remains poorly understood. Of particular importance are dynamic spatial patterns such as spiral waves that perpetually move and transmit information. We developed an open-source software for simulating a field of cells that communicate by secreting any number of molecules. With this software and a theory, we identified all possible ``cellular dialogues''\textemdash ways of communicating with two diffusing molecules\textemdash that yield diverse dynamic spatial patterns. These patterns emerge despite widely varying responses of cells to the molecules, gene-expression noise, spatial arrangements, and cell movements. A three-stage, ``order-fluctuate-settle'' process forms dynamic spatial patterns: cells form long-lived whirlpools of wavelets that, following erratic dynamics, settle into a dynamic spatial pattern. Our work helps in identifying generegulatory networks that underlie dynamic pattern formations.},

Despite the common belief that knots are too complicated for incorporation into proteins, knots have been identified in the native fold of a growing number of proteins. The discovery of proteins with this unique backbone characteristic has challenged the preconceptions about the complexity of biological structures, as well as current folding theories. Given the intricacies of the knotted geometry, the interplay between a protein's fold, structure, and function is of particular interest. Interestingly, for most of these proteins, the knotted region appears critical both in folding and function, although full understanding of these contributions is still incomplete. Here, we experimentally reveal the impact of the knot on the landscape, the origin of the bistable nature of the knotted protein, and broaden the view of knot formation as uniquely decoupled from folding.},

  abstract = {The growing adoption of generalized-ensemble algorithms for biomolecular simulation has resulted in a resurgence in the use of the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) to make use of all data generated by these simulations. Unfortunately, the original presentation of WHAM by Kumar et al. is not directly applicable to data generated by these methods. WHAM was originally formulated to combine data from independent samplings of the canonical ensemble, whereas many generalized-ensemble algorithms sample from mixtures of canonical ensembles at different temperatures. Sorting configurations generated from a parallel tempering simulation by temperature obscures the temporal correlation in the data and results in an improper treatment of the statistical uncertainties used in constructing the estimate of the density of states. Here we present variants of WHAM, STWHAM and PTWHAM, derived with the same set of assumptions, that can be directly applied to several generalized ensemble algorithms, including simulated tempering, parallel tempering (better known as replica-exchange among temperatures), and replica-exchange simulated tempering. We present methods that explicitly capture the considerable temporal correlation in sequentially generated configurations using autocorrelation analysis. This allows estimation of the statistical uncertainty in WHAM estimates of expectations for the canonical ensemble. We test the method with a one-dimensional model system and then apply it to the estimation of potentials of mean force from parallel tempering simulations of the alanine dipeptide in both implicit and explicit solvent.},

Here, we suggest a conceptually simple automated procedure that does not make strict assumptions about the distribution of the observable of interest in which the equilibration time is chosen to maximize the number of effectively uncorrelated samples in the production timespan used to compute equilibrium averages. We present a simple Python reference implementation of this procedure and demonstrate its utility on typical molecular simulation data.},

While a decade ago minimalist toy models were mainly designed to test general hypotheses on the principles regulating protein folding, the latest coarse-grained models are increasingly realistic and can be used to characterize quantitatively the detailed folding mechanism of specific proteins. The ability of such models to reproduce the essential features of folding dynamics suggests that each single atomic degree of freedom is not by itself particularly relevant to folding and supports a statistical mechanical approach to characterize folding transitions. When combined with more refined models and with experimental studies, the systematic investigation of protein systems and complexes using coarse-grained models can advance our theoretical understanding of the actual organizing principles that emerge from the complex network of interactions among protein atomic constituents.},

This paper presents a method for systematically identifying different topological features of the convolutions of the backbone. We define a loop as a segment of chain whose end residues are in contact. We find some loops which are threaded by another segment of chain passing through the loop or actually linked with another loop. Fifty-six loop threadings were found among the 20 proteins studied, all of them occurring in a subset of seven proteins. In our sample, threadings and linkings were generally found if and only if the protein has more than 200 residues. To account for the existence of these topological features, despite their apparent entropic unfavorability, we have proposed a number of kinetic mechanisms by which they may form without a thread actually passing through a loop. We have found that almost all loop threadings possess structural features that would make one of these mechanisms plausible.},

  abstract = {Biomolecules are the prime information processing elements of living matter. Most of these inanimate systems are polymers that compute their own structures and dynamics using as input seemingly random character strings of their sequence, following which they coalesce and perform integrated cellular functions. In large computational systems with finite interaction-codes, the appearance of conflicting goals is inevitable. Simple conflicting forces can lead to quite complex structures and behaviors, leading to the concept of frustration in condensed matter. We present here some basic ideas about frustration in biomolecules and how the frustration concept leads to a better appreciation of many aspects of the architecture of biomolecules, and especially how biomolecular structure connects to function by means of localized frustration. These ideas are simultaneously both seductively simple and perilously subtle to grasp completely. The energy landscape theory of protein folding provides a framework for quantifying frustration in large systems and has been implemented at many levels of description. We first review the notion of frustration from the areas of abstract logic and its uses in simple condensed matter systems. We discuss then how the frustration concept applies specifically to heteropolymers, testing folding landscape theory in computer simulations of protein models and in experimentally accessible systems. Studying the aspects of frustration averaged over many proteins provides ways to infer energy functions useful for reliable structure prediction. We discuss how frustration affects folding mechanisms. We review here how the biological functions of proteins are related to subtle local physical frustration effects and how frustration influences the appearance of metastable states, the nature of binding processes, catalysis and allosteric transitions. In this review, we also emphasize that frustration, far from being always a bad thing, is an essential feature of biomolecules that allows dynamics to be harnessed for function. In this way, we hope to illustrate how Frustration is a fundamental concept in molecular biology.},

  abstract = {Growing computing capacity and algorithmic advances have facilitated the study of increasingly large biomolecular systems at longer timescales. However, with these larger, more complex systems come questions about the quality of sampling and statistical convergence. What size systems can be sampled fully? If a system is not fully sampled, can certain ``fast variables'' be considered wellconverged? How can one determine the statistical significance of observed results? The present review describes statistical tools and the underlying physical ideas necessary to address these questions. Basic definitions and ready-to-use analyses are provided, along with explicit recommendations. Such statistical analyses are of paramount importance in establishing the reliability of simulation data in any given study.},

Many systems of interest are highly complex, often at the edge of current computational capabilities. Modelers must therefore analyze and communicate statistical uncertainties so that ``consumers'' of simulated data understand its significance and limitations.

  abstract = {Traditional protein force fields use one set of parameters for most of the 20 amino acids (AAs), allowing transferability of the parameters. However, a significant shortcoming is the difficulty to fit the Ramachandran plots of all AA residues simultaneously, affecting the accuracy of the force field. In this Feature Article, we report a new strategy for protein force field parametrization. Backbone and side-chain conformational distributions of all 20 AA residues obtained from protein coil library were used as the target data. The dihedral angle (torsion) potentials and some local nonbonded (1-4/1-5/1-6) interactions in OPLS-AA/L force field were modified such that the target data can be excellently reproduced by molecular dynamics simulations of dipeptides (blocked AAs) in explicit water, resulting in a new force field with AA-specific parameters, RSFF1. An efficient free energy decomposition approach was developed to separate the corrections on {$\phi$} and {$\psi$} from the two-dimensional Ramachandran plots. RSFF1 is shown to reproduce the experimental NMR 3J-coupling constants of AA dipeptides better than other force fields. It has a good balance between {$\alpha$}-helical and {$\beta$}-sheet secondary structures. It can successfully fold a set of {$\alpha$}-helix proteins (Trp-cage and Homeodomain) and {$\beta$}-hairpins (Trpzip-2, GB1 hairpin), which cannot be consistently stabilized by other state-of-the-art force fields. Interestingly, the RSFF1 force field systematically overestimates the melting temperature (and the stability of native state) of these peptides/proteins. It has a potential application in the simulation of protein folding and protein structure refinement.},

In this review we provide an overview of coarse-grained models focusing on their design, including choices of representation, models of energy functions, sampling of conformational space, and applications in the modeling of protein structure, dynamics, and interactions. A more detailed description is given for applications of coarse-grained models suitable for efficient combinations with all-atom simulations in multiscale modeling strategies.},

So far, all crystallographic studies on type III AFPs were carried out using the Atlantic ocean pout Macrozoarces americanus as the source organism. Here we present the crystal structure of a type III AFP from a different zoarcid fish, and at an ultra-high resolution of 0.62 A\r{} . The protein fold of RD1 comprises a compact globular domain with two internal tandem motifs arranged about a pseudo-dyad symmetry. Each motif of the ``pretzel fold'' includes four short b-strands and a 310 helix. There is a novel internal cavity of 45 A\r{} 3 surrounded by eight conserved nonpolar residues. The model contains several residues with alternate conformations, and a number of split water molecules, probably caused by alternate interactions with the protein molecule. After extensive refinement that includes hydrogen atoms, significant residual electron densities associated with the electrons of peptides and many other bonds could be visualized.},

We find that a 29-residue zinc-finger domain normally folding close to the uL23 loop folds deeper in the tunnel in uL23 {$\Delta$}loop ribosomes, while two \textasciitilde{} 100 residue proteins normally folding close to the uL24 loop near the tunnel exit port fold at deeper locations in uL24 {$\Delta$}loop ribosomes, in good agreement with results obtained by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations.

  abstract = {A lattice model of protein folding is developed to distinguish between amino acid sequences that do and do not fold into unique conformations. Although Monte Carlo simulations provide insights into the long-time processes involved in protein folding, these simulations cannot systematically chart the conformational energy surface that enables folding. By assuming that protein folding occurs after chain collapse, a kinetic map of important pathways on this surface is constructed through the use of an analytical theory of probability flow. Convergent kinetic pathways, or "folding funnels," guide folding to a unique, stable, native conformation. Solution of the probability flow equations is facilitated by limiting treatment to diffusion between geometrically similar collapsed conformers. Similarity is measured in terms of a reconfigurational distance. Two specific amino acid sequences are deemed foldable and nonfoldable because one gives rise to a single, large folding funnel leading to a native conformation and the other has multiple pathways leading to several stable conformers. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that folding funnel calculations accurately predict the fact of and the pathways involved in folding-specific sequences. The existence of folding funnels for specific sequences suggests that geometrically related families of stable, collapsed conformers fulfill kinetic and thermodynamic requirements of protein folding.},

  abstract = {The importance of knots and entanglements in biological systems is increasingly being realized and the number of proteins with topologically complex knotted structures has risen. However, the mechanism as to how these proteins knot and fold efficiently remains unclear. Using a cell-free expression system and pulse-proteolysis experiments, we have investigated the mechanism of knotting and folding for two bacterial trefoil-knotted methyltransferases. This study provides the first experimental evidence for a knotting mechanism. Results on fusions of stable protein domains to N-terminus, C-terminus or both termini of the knotted proteins clearly demonstrate that threading of the nascent chain through a knotting loop occurs via the C-terminus. Our results strongly suggest that this mechanism occurs even when the C-terminus is severely hindered by the addition of a large stable structure, in contrast to some simulations indicating that even the folding pathways of knotted proteins have some plasticity. The same strategy was employed to probe the effects of GroEL-GroES. In this case, results suggest active mechanisms for the molecular chaperonin. We demonstrate that a simple model in which GroEL-GroES sterically confines the unknotted polypeptide chain thereby promoting knotting is unlikely, and we propose two alternatives: (a) the chaperonin facilitates unfolding of kinetically and topologically trapped intermediates or (b) the chaperonin stabilizes interactions that promote knotting. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the folding of knotted proteins both in vitro and in vivo, thus elucidating how they have withstood evolutionary pressures regardless of their complex topologies and intrinsically slow folding rates.},

  abstract = {An elementary statistical mechanical model was used to calculate the folding rates for 22 proteins from their known three-dimensional structures. In this model, residues come into contact only after all of the intervening chain is in the native conformation. An additional simplifying assumption is that native structure grows from localized regions that then fuse to form the complete native molecule. The free energy function for this model contains just two contributions\textemdash conformational entropy of the backbone and the energy of the inter-residue contacts. The matrix of interresidue interactions is obtained from the atomic coordinates of the three-dimensional structure. For the 18 proteins that exhibit two-state equilibrium and kinetic behavior, profiles of the free energy versus the number of native peptide bonds show two deep minima, corresponding to the native and denatured states. For four proteins known to exhibit intermediates in folding, the free energy profiles show additional deep minima. The calculated rates of folding the two-state proteins, obtained by solving a diffusion equation for motion on the free energy profiles, reproduce the experimentally determined values surprisingly well. The success of these calculations suggests that folding speed is largely determined by the distribution and strength of contacts in the native structure. We also calculated the effect of mutations on the folding kinetics of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, the most intensively studied two-state protein, with some success.},

Lassos arise in proteins with disulfide bridges (or in proteins with amide linkages), when termini of a protein backbone pierce through an auxiliary surface of minimal area, spanned on a covalent loop. We find that as much as 18\% of all proteins with disulfide bridges in a non-redundant subset of PDB form complex lassos, and classify them into six distinct geometric classes, one of which resembles supercoiling known from DNA. Based on biological classification of proteins we find that lassos are much more common in viruses, plants and fungi than in other kingdoms of life. We also discuss how changes in the oxidation/reduction potential may affect the function of proteins with lassos. Lassos and associated surfaces of minimal area provide new, interesting and possessing many potential applications geometric characteristics not only of proteins, but also of other biomolecules.},

Thus, for small protein domains, the ribosome itself can provide the kind of sheltered folding environment that chaperones provide for larger proteins.},

We recently introduced an all-atom SBM that explicitly represents the atomic geometry of a biomolecule. While this initial study showed the robustness of the all-atom SBM Hamiltonian to changes in many of the energetic parameters, an important aspect, which has not been explored previously, is the definition of native interactions. In this study, we propose a general definition for generating atomically grained contact maps called ``Shadow''. The Shadow algorithm initially considers all atoms within a cutoff distance and then, controlled by a screening parameter, discards the occluded contacts. We show that this choice of contact map is not only well behaved for protein folding, since it produces consistently cooperative folding behavior in SBMs but also desirable for exploring the dynamics of macromolecular assemblies since, it distributes energy similarly between RNAs and proteins despite their disparate internal packing. All-atom structure-based models employing Shadow contact maps provide a general framework for exploring the geometrical features of biomolecules, especially the connections between folding and function.},

To investigate the validity of such models, we determine the role of native and nonnative interactions along folding and unfolding pathways. For this purpose, we use a molecular mechanics energy function with an implicit solvation model (an effective energy function or potential of mean force) that can be expressed in a pairwise decomposable form. We find that for the native state and a wide range of other configurations, the contact energy is an accurate description, in part due to the cancellation of non-zero contributions from more distant residues. However, significant errors in the energy are introduced for non-native structures if the energy is calculated from the native contacts alone. Non-native contacts tend to make a significant contribution, particularly for molten globules and collapsed states along the unfolding pathways. The implication of these results for the use of Go៮ type models in studies of protein folding are discussed. Proteins 2002;47:379 \textendash 392.},

A kinetic transition network is constructed using the discrete path sampling approach, and the resulting potential energy surface is visualized by constructing disconnectivity graphs. Owing to topological constraints, the low-lying portion of the landscape consists of three distinct regions, corresponding to the native knotted state and to configurations where either the N or C terminus is not yet folded into the knot. The fastest folding pathways from denatured states exhibit early formation of the N terminus portion of the knot and a rate-determining step where the C terminus is incorporated. The low-lying minima with the N terminus knotted and the C terminus free therefore constitute an off-pathway intermediate for this model. The insertion of both the N and C termini into the knot occurs late in the folding process, creating large energy barriers that are the rate limiting steps in the folding process. When compared to other protein folding proteins of a similar length, this system folds over six orders of magnitude more slowly.},

RESULTS: Tools are described for the analysis of ligand-protein contacts (LPC software) and contacts of structural units (CSU software) such as helices, sheets, strands and residues. Our approach is based on a detailed analysis of interatomic contacts and interface complementarity. For any ligand or structural unit, these software automatically: (i) calculate the solvent-accessible surface of every atom; (ii) determine the contacting residues and type of interaction they undergo (hydrophobic-hydrophobic, aromatic-aromatic, etc.); (iii) indicate all putative hydrogen bonds. LPC software further predicts changes in binding strength following chemical modification of the ligand. AVAILABILITY: Both LPC and CSU can be accessed through the PDB and are integrated in the 3DB Atlas page of all PDB files. For any given file, the tools can also be accessed at http://www.pdb.bnl. gov/pdb-bin/lpc?PDB\_ID= and http://www.pdb.bnl. gov/pdb-bin/csu?PDB\_ID= with the four-letter PDB code added at the end in each case.

The thermodynamic properties of various sequences are examined contrasting the behavior of good and poor folding sequences. The good (fast folding) sequences have sharp well-defined thermodynamic transitions while the slow folding sequences have broad ones. We find two independent transitions: a collapse transition to compact states and a folding transition from compact states to the native state. The collapse transition is second order-like, while folding is first order. The system is also studied as a function of the energy parameters. In particular, as the average energetic drive toward compactness is reduced, the two transitions approach each other. At zero average drive, collapse and folding occur almost simultaneously; i.e., the chain collapses directly into the native state. At a specific value of this energy drive the folding temperature falls below the glass point, indicating that the chain is now trapped in local minimum. By varying one parameter in this simple model, we obtain a diverse array of behaviors which may be useful in understanding the different folding properties of various proteins.},

This criterion is motivated by the fact that stretching processes usually start with the native structure, in the vicinity of which the G\=o-like models should work the best. Our selection procedure is applied to 62 different versions of the G\=o model and is based on 28 proteins. We consider different potentials, contact maps, local stiffness energies, and energy scales\textemdash uniform and nonuniform. In the latter case, the strength of the nonuniformity was governed either by specificity or by properties related to positioning of the side groups. Among them is the simplest variant: uniform couplings with no i, i + 2 contacts. This choice also leads to good folding properties in most cases. We elucidate relationship between the local stiffness described by a potential which involves local chirality and the one which involves dihedral and bond angles. The latter stiffness improves folding but there is little difference between them when it comes to stretching.},

It also illustrates that native contacts are sufficient to guarantee folding in around 1-2\% of the simulations, and how slipknot intermediates are needed to reduce the topological bottlenecks. As expected, simulations of proteins with similar structure but with knot removed fold much more efficiently, clearly demonstrating the origin of these topological barriers.

Here, we highlight the key role of kinetic trapping of the protein native state relative to unfolded, intermediate and, most importantly, aggregated states. We propose that kinetic trapping serves an important role in biology by protecting the bioactive states of a large number of proteins from deleterious aggregation. In the event that undesired aggregates were somehow formed, specialized intracellular disaggregation machines have evolved to convert any aberrant populations back to the native state, thus restoring a fully bioactive and aggregationprotected protein cohort.},

For example, some proteins fold apparently in a kinetically two-state manner, whereas others follow complex routes to the native state. We have set out to provide a theoretical basis for understanding the diverse behavior seen in the refolding kinetics of proteins in terms of properties that are intrinsic to the sequence. Results: The folding kinetics of a number of sequences for off-lattice continuum models of proteins is studied using Langevin simulations at two different values of the friction coefficient. We show for these models that there is a remarkable correlation between folding time, {$\tau$}F, and {$\sigma$}=(T\texttheta{} \textendash{} TF)/T\texttheta, where T\texttheta{} and TF are the equilibrium collapse and folding transition temperatures, respectively. The microscopic dynamics reveals that several scenarios for the kinetics of refolding arise depending on the range of values of {$\sigma$}. For relatively small {$\sigma$}, the chain reaches the native conformation by a direct native conformation nucleation collapse (NCNC) mechanism without being trapped in any detectable intermediates. For moderate and large values of {$\sigma$}, the kinetics is described by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, according to which a fraction of molecules {$\Phi$} (kinetic partition factor) reach the native conformation via the NCNC mechanism. The remaining fraction attains the native state by off-pathway processes that involve trapping in several misfolded structures. The rate-determining step in the off-pathway processes is the transition from the misfolded structures to the native state. The partition factor {$\Phi$} is also determined by {$\sigma$}: the smaller the value of {$\sigma$}, the larger is {$\Phi$}. The qualitative aspects of our results are found to be independent of the friction coefficient. The simulation results and theoretical arguments are used to obtain estimates for timescales for folding via the NCNC mechanism in small proteins, those with less than about 70 amino acid residues. Conclusions We have shown that the various scenarios for folding of proteins, and possibly other biomolecules, can be classified solely in terms of {$\sigma$}. Proteins with small values of {$\sigma$} reach the native conformation via a nucleation collapse mechanism and their energy landscape is characterized by having one dominant native basin of attraction (NBA). On the other hand, proteins with large {$\sigma$} get trapped in competing basins of attraction (CBAs) in which they adopt misfolded structures. Only a small fraction of molecules access the native state rapidly when {$\sigma$} is large. For these sequences, the majority of the molecules approach the native state by a three-stage multipathway mechanism in which the rate-determining step involves a transition from one of the CBAs to the NBA.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of proteins are being discovered with a remarkable and somewhat surprising feature, a knot in their native structures. How the polypeptide chain is able to ``knot'' itself during the folding process to form these highly intricate protein topologies is not known. Here we perform a computational study on the 160-amino-acid homodimeric protein YibK, which, like other proteins in the SpoU family of MTases, contains a deep trefoil knot in its C-terminal region. In this study, we use a coarse-grained C{$\alpha$}-chain representation and Langevin dynamics to study folding kinetics. We find that specific, attractive nonnative interactions are critical for knot formation. In the absence of these interactions, i.e., in an energetics driven entirely by native interactions, knot formation is exceedingly unlikely. Further, we find, in concert with recent experimental data on YibK, two parallel folding pathways that we attribute to an early and a late formation of the trefoil knot, respectively. For both pathways, knot formation occurs before dimerization. A bioinformatics analysis of the SpoU family of proteins reveals further that the critical nonnative interactions may originate from evolutionary conserved hydrophobic segments around the knotted region.},

  abstract = {While the energy landscape theory of protein folding is now a widely accepted view for understanding how relatively weak molecular interactions lead to rapid and cooperative protein folding, such a framework must be extended to describe the large-scale functional motions observed in molecular machines. In this review, we discuss (1) the development of the energy landscape theory of biomolecular folding, (2) recent advances toward establishing a consistent understanding of folding and function and (3) emerging themes in the functional motions of enzymes, biomolecular motors and other biomolecular machines. Recent theoretical, computational and experimental lines of investigation have provided a very dynamic picture of biomolecular motion. In contrast to earlier ideas, where molecular machines were thought to function similarly to macroscopic machines, with rigid components that move along a few degrees of freedom in a deterministic fashion, biomolecular complexes are only marginally stable. Since the stabilizing contribution of each atomic interaction is on the order of the thermal fluctuations in solution, the rigid body description of molecular function must be revisited. An emerging theme is that functional motions encompass order\textendash disorder transitions and structural flexibility provides significant contributions to the free energy. In this review, we describe the biological importance of order\textendash disorder transitions and discuss the statistical\textendash mechanical foundation of theoretical approaches that can characterize such transitions.},

  abstract = {Recently, we developed a residue-specific force field (RSFF1) based on conformational free-energy distributions of the 20 amino acid residues from a protein coil library. Most parameters in RSFF1 were adopted from the OPLS-AA/L force field, but some van der Waals and torsional parameters that effectively affect local conformational preferences were introduced specifically for individual residues to fit the coil library distributions. Here a similar strategy has been applied to modify the Amber ff99SB force field, and a new force field named RSFF2 is developed. It can successfully fold {$\alpha$}-helical structures such as polyalanine peptides, Trp-cage miniprotein, and villin headpiece subdomain and {$\beta$}-sheet structures such as Trpzip-2, GB1 {$\beta$}-hairpins, and the WW domain, simultaneously. The properties of various popular force fields in balancing between {$\alpha$}-helix and {$\beta$}-sheet are analyzed based on their descriptions of local conformational features of various residues, and the analysis reveals the importance of accurate local free-energy distributions. Unlike the RSFF1, which overestimates the stability of both {$\alpha$}-helix and {$\beta$}sheet, RSFF2 gives melting curves of {$\alpha$}-helical peptides and Trp-cage in good agreement with experimental data. Fitting to the two-state model, RSFF2 gives folding enthalpies and entropies in reasonably good agreement with available experimental results.},
