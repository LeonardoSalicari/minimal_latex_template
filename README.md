# Minimal Latex templates
Very simple Latex templates for general porpuse. They are also a Minimal Working Example (MWE).

Each `.tex` file needs the `.sty` which contains all packages and the `.bib` that contains an example of bibliography.

### Compilation
1. `pdflatex`
2. `biblatex`
3. `pdflatex`
4. `pdflatex`

Nevertheless, I suggest to use [latexmk](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html). A simple Perl script which takes care of this compilation process, and there are good chances that you already have it (it is bundled with MikTex and all major Linux Latex bundles).
